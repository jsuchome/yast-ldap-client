<h1>YaST2: Ldap-client module</h1>

<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>
SL 8.2 (and even more later versions) should operate with LDAP much more than
it used to be. Documentation to all the large area called "LDAP enablement"
could be found at
<br>
<a href="http://w3.suse.de/~rhafer/LDAP/">http://w3.suse.de/~rhafer/LDAP</a>

and in yast2/planning CVS directory.
<p>
These changes include (from YaST side)
<ul>
<li>create new universal agent for accesing and modifying data in LDAP directory
<li>enhance yast2-client module to enable large configuration of data stored in
LDAP
<li>adapt modules which need to work with LDAP (e.g. yast2-users)
<li>write a module for configuration of LDAP server
</ul>

This document describes the changes of ldap-client module.
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
According to
<a href="http://w3.suse.de/~rhafer/LDAP/suse-ldap.html">Ralf's proposal</a>, we
must add some dialogs to configure various "modules" (e.g. user configuration).
All the data should be stored in LDAP, in the local file (ldap.conf) there will
be one new value (Main Configuration Object) which is the base DN for searching
all other configuration data.

Here is the dialog proposal.
<h3>Workflow</h3>

<h3>Summary dialog</h3>
<p>
This should remain simple is to enable fast configuration if user don't need
much (or just for enabling/disabling the services).

<h3>Advanced Configuration Dialog</h3>
<p>
Dialog for configuring main configuration DN's (base, template) and show
the "modules", which could be configured (in the table).
<b>Problems</b>
<ul>
<li>First value is written in the config file, while others are stored in LDAP
- this is not very consistent
<li>What if the main DN is changed? Should be everything moved in LDAP tree? Or
should it be just new start point for new values, stored at other place?
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Advanced Configuration Dialog</h3>
<p>
For configuration of one specified module (here the users configuration).
The table contains some values common for each module (like Default Base or
Default Filter) and some module-specific (like Password Length for users).
<br>
Maybe the ObjectClass should not be allowed to edit.
<b>Problem</b>
<ul>
<li>As before - should be allowed changing of cn (which implies change of DN)
when something is already configured?
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Template Configuration Dialog</h3>
<p>
Configuration of template values. There is one table with  default template
attributes (they cannot be deleted, only ignored) and one table for setting
the defaultValue attribute.
<br>
<b>Problem</b>
<ul>
<li>The attribute of secondaryGroup is not very easy to edit with our widgets...
</ul>
</ul>
