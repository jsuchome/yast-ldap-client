<h1>YaST2: Ldap-client module</h1>

<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>
SL 8.2 (and even more later versions) should operate with LDAP much more than
it used to be. Documentation to all the large area called "LDAP enablement"
could be found at
<br>
<a href="http://w3.suse.de/~rhafer/LDAP/">http://w3.suse.de/~rhafer/LDAP</a>

and in yast2/planning CVS directory.
<p>
These changes include (from YaST side)
<ul>
<li>create new universal agent for accesing and modifying data in LDAP directory
<li>enhance yast2-client module to enable large configuration of data stored in
LDAP
<li>adapt modules which need to work with LDAP (e.g. yast2-users)
<li>write a module for configuration of LDAP server
</ul>

This document describes the changes of ldap-client module.
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
According to
<a href="http://w3.suse.de/~rhafer/LDAP/suse-ldap.html">Ralf's proposal</a>, we
must add some dialogs to configure various "modules" (e.g. user configuration).
All the data should be stored in LDAP, in the local file (ldap.conf) there will
be one new value (Main Configuration Object) which is the base DN for searching
all other configuration data.

Here is the dialog proposal.
<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>

<h3>Summary dialog</h3>
<p>
This should remain simple is to enable fast configuration if user don't need
much (or just for enabling/disabling the services).
<p>

<h3>Advanced Configuration Dialog</h3>
<p>
Dialog for configuring the access to LDAP server (main configuration DN - 
the place for configuration objects - and bind DN) and various other settings
(file server - the flag used by users module to check if manipulation with
homes is possible).
<p>

<p>
<b>Configure</b> button leads to configuration of objects, stored at LDAP server
, so the password popup is displayed before Modules Configuration Dialog:

<h3>Modules Configuration Dialog</h3>
<p>
For configuration of specialized "config modules" (currently users and groups
configuration).
<br>
ComboButton allows to change currently configured module.
<br>
The table contains all attributes allowed for the module (including the
empty - not set - ones). Some of them are common for each module (like
defaultBase or cn) and some are module-specific (like skelDir for users).
<p>

<p>
User can create new configuration module (but only one for each type at one
level of LDAP tree). This popup is opened for creation:
<p>

<p>
For changing the values in table, "change value popup" is used. It is differed,
when only single value could be entered:
<p>

<p>
... and when the list of values could be used. In this case, list of propose
values could be provided (if available):
<p>

<p>
<p>
From <b>Modules Configuration Dialog</b> we can move to <b>Template Configuration Dialog</b> by using MenuButton at the bottom, which shows the list of
templates available for editing (the list entries are the values of
"defaultTemplate" attribute): 
<p>
<img src="05_ldap-client.png">
<p>


<h3>Template Configuration Dialog</h3>
<p>
Configuration of template values. There is one table with general template
attributes (they cannot be deleted, only ignored) and one table for setting
the defaultValue attribute. In default values, some kind of regular expressions
is allowed.
<p>
<img src="09_ldap-client.png">
<p>
When user wants to add new "default Value", AddDefaultValue Popup is opened.
It offers the list of attibutes which could have new object according to the
"defaultObjectClass" attribute of template (in the example, "loginShell" is 
derived from "posixAccount" value in "defaultObjectClass" attribute):
